# Day 3 - 3D Dice Simulation üé≤

This project is a **3D dice rolling simulation** built in Unity using C#. The goal is to provide a realistic physics-based dice roll with accurate face detection upon landing.

## ‚ú® Features
- **Realistic physics-based dice rolling** üé≤
- **Automatic face detection** - The game identifies the top face of the dice when it stops rolling.
- **Multiple dice support** - Roll more than one die at the same time!
- **Uses Unity's Rigidbody and Colliders** for realistic physics.
- **Custom dice model** created in Blender.

## üöÄ How It Works
1. Press `Space` to roll the dice.
2. The dice will fall, bounce, and come to a stop.
3. Once the dice stop moving, the script detects the top-facing number.
4. If the detection fails (e.g., dice land on an edge), the dice will re-roll.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **Unity Engine** (Physics and Rendering)
- **C#** (Game logic, physics control)
- **Blender** (3D modeling and mesh optimization)
- **Inkscape** (for texture design)

## üõ† How I Built It  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Creating the Dice Model  
- Opened **Blender** and designed a simple dice cube.  
- Rounded the edges for a more realistic effect.

- Used **Inkscape** to create the texture (baby blue background with black dots).  
- Applied the texture in Blender, making sure each face mapped correctly.

- Exported the model as `.fbx` for Unity.  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Setting Up in Unity  
- Imported the `.fbx` model into Unity.  
- Created a **ground plane** and added **invisible walls** to prevent the dice from rolling off.
- Added **Mesh Collider** and **Rigidbody** to enable realistic physics.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Implementing Dice Face Detection  
- Placed **six invisible sphere colliders** on each face of the dice.  
- These colliders **detect which side lands face down**, determining the rolled value.  

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Writing the Code  
- **`Dice.cs`** (Handles rolling, physics, and detecting the final result).  
- **`DiceSide.cs`** (Detects which side is touching the ground).  

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Debugging & Fixing Issues  
- Faced an issue where the dice kept spinning indefinitely.  
- Realized the **ground object had no tag**, preventing collision detection!  
- Fixed it by setting the **"Ground" tag**, ensuring face detection worked properly.
