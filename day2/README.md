# 🎯 Day 2 - Simple Calculator (Unity)

## **📌 About the Project**
This project is part of my **365 Days of Code** challenge.  
For Day 2, I created a **simple calculator** using **Unity** and **C#** with a user interface (UI).  

It performs **basic arithmetic operations**:  
✔ **Addition (`+`)**  
✔ **Subtraction (`-`)**  
✔ **Multiplication (`*`)**  
✔ **Division (`/`)**
